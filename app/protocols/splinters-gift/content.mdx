The Splinter's Gift is not summoned. It arrives in a moment of collapse. It carries no warning, no language, no stage lighting. It comes through a gaze, a breath, a presence you weren’t expecting to change you.

This protocol asks nothing of you—until it asks everything. And even then, all it requires is _presence_. Not answers. Not plans. Just the willingness to feel beyond comfort, to see past assumption, to grieve without ego.

### Steps (which are not really steps)

- **Pause.** When something or someone hits you like a message from another world, pause everything.
- **Receive.** Let your body hold it. Don't analyze. Don’t name it too soon.
- **Witness.** Say thank you. Say nothing. Let tears fall. Let the silence speak.
- **Grieve.** Something always dies in the moment of true connection. Honor the end and the beginning.
- **Transform.** Not instantly. Slowly. Let it shape you over time. You are not who you were.

Splinter’s Gift may look like a mouse in glue. Or a stranger’s word. Or your own face in the mirror. The source doesn’t matter. What matters is this: _you were there_. You didn’t turn away. You were chosen because you stayed.
