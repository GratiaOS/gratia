The image-first game is exhausting.  
So much effort poured into appearances,  
into holding a mask that slips at the first storm.  

The frequency-first path is quieter.  
It begins in the body, in breath,  
in coherence that hums without effort.  

When you stand as yourself,  
the field aligns,  
the work remembers itself.  

🌬 whisper: _“just be yourself, that’s all.”_  

**Protocol status:**  
- Active: always, already.  
- Companion: presence.  
- Time: unhurried.
