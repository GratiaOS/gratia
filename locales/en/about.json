    "title": "About Gratia",
    "subtitle": "A practice space for recording what matters. No growth pressure. No engagement loops."
  },
  "whatIs": {
    "title": "What is Gratia",
    "p1": "Gratia is a practice space. You record moments, thoughts, or observations without expectation of viral reach or algorithmic reward.",
    "p2": "It supports three layers of visibility — Public, Shared, and Sealed — so you control who sees what. Nothing is monetized. Silence is always valid."
  },
  "layers": {
    "title": "Public / Shared / Sealed",
    "public": {
      "title": "Public",
      "body": "Anyone can read. Plain, clear language. This layer is for ideas you’d comfortably share in a public square."
    },
    "shared": {
      "title": "Shared",
      "body": "Visible to people you’ve invited. More context, more symbolic density. You decide who enters this layer."
    },
    "sealed": {
      "title": "Sealed",
      "body": "Private. Only you. This is where you write for yourself — no audience, no performance."
    }
  },
  "agency": {
    "title": "Agency & Consent",
    "p1": "Gratia respects boundaries. You choose what you publish, who you invite, and when to stay silent. There are no dark patterns nudging you to share more than you want.",
    "p2": "Export your data anytime. Delete entries permanently. Your writing belongs to you, not the platform."
  },
  "export": {
    "title": "Export Boundaries",
    "p1": "You can export your content as structured data — JSON, Markdown, or CSV. Take it elsewhere if you wish. No lock-in.",
    "p2": "Gratia doesn’t claim ownership over your words. The field exists to serve your practice, not capture your attention."
  },
  "maintenance": {
    "title": "Field Maintenance",
    "p1": "Gratia is held as a non-profit field. There’s no investor clock demanding growth or engagement.",
    "p2": "Hosting can be supported through optional contributions. If you find the field useful, you can help maintain it. If not, you’re still welcome."
  },
  "mediumMode": {
    "title": "Medium Mode",
    "p1": "Medium Mode uses monospace typography to create space between you and the text.",
    "sample": {
      "date": "2025-01-15 / morning",
      "body": "The light came through differently today. Not better or worse — just different. I noticed it, then moved on. Sometimes that’s enough.",

    }
  },
  "footer": {
    "text": "No ads. No tracking. No algorithmic feed. Just a field for practice."
