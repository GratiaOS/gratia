Gratia is a living garden — a quiet OS for presence, creation, and shared experiments.
It is not a product, a platform, or a belief system.
It is a field held through structure, restraint, and care.

Gratia holds the seeds and protocols for things that grow around it: M3, Firegate, Firecircle, Codex :: Vienna, and beyond.

## What Gratia Is Not

To avoid confusion, drift, or projection, Gratia is explicit about its limits.

Gratia is **not**:

- a self‑help system
- a spiritual authority
- a productivity tool
- a social network
- a therapy substitute
- a content machine

It does not promise outcomes.
It does not optimize engagement.
It does not try to keep you.

---

## Identity

Gratia is held within a non‑profit association (in formation), to protect its independence and prevent capture.

**Public identity:**

- **Name:** Asociación GRATIA – Ciudad de los Gatos (Asociación en formación)
- **Place:** Casbas de Huesca · España
- **Web:** https://gratia.space
- **Contact:** contact@gratia.space

No physical street address is published in this repo. Privacy is part of the garden.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Edit any page inside `app/` — the site will auto‑update.

---

## Scripts

- `pnpm dev` → run locally at http://localhost:3000
- `pnpm build` → production build
- `pnpm start` → run built app
- `pnpm lint` → run linter
- `pnpm format` → format code with Prettier

---

## Stack & Styling

Gratia uses a small, opinionated stack:

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind v4 utilities + `@gratiaos/tokens` + `@gratiaos/ui`
- **Design tokens:** Garden‑core palette and typography wired through `globals.css`
- **Type:** custom Gratia typefaces (Gratia, Selari, Bilute) with system fallbacks

Pages like `/vortex` and `/codex/vienna` use the same token system for mood, motion, and depth.

---

## Deploy

This repo is set up for **Vercel**.

Push to `main` → deploys to [gratia.space](https://www.gratia.space).

No analytics, no trackers — this garden is private by default.

---

## Contributing

This is a shared garden. Fork, branch, and propose — but remember:

- every commit should carry a **whisper** (a small line of intent in the message)
- changes should respect calm, clarity, and lower noise, not higher

If you’re unsure, open an issue or draft PR and describe the feeling you’re aiming for.

---

## Internal Guardrails

This project is guided by a small set of non‑negotiables.

We do **not**:

- promise transformation or healing
- capture attention or create dependency
- centralize voice or authority
- export private (Sealed) material
- escalate emotion to persuade
- monetize the ritual itself

These limits matter more than new features.
If something conflicts with them, we don’t do it.

## Whisper

🌬 whisper: _"creation remembers it is safe here."_
