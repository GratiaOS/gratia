### Gratia — Structure Over Personality

This document explains **how Gratia is built** and **why it stays safe**.
It is intentionally short.

If something here conflicts with `WHAT_WE_DO_NOT_DO.md`, this document yields.

---

## 1. Architectural Principle

> **Structure carries meaning. People do not.**

Gratia is designed so that:

- no individual is required for continuity
- no voice becomes canonical
- evolution happens by changing structure, not tone

---

## 2. Registers (Interaction Layers)

Gratia operates through three explicit registers. These are structural, not emotional.

### Public

- observable
- commentable
- exportable
- lowest symbolic density

Used for:

- articles
- comments
- examples
- demonstrations

### Shared

- semi-private
- contextual
- witnessed
- medium symbolic density

Used for:

- annotations
- responses
- collaborative reflection

### Sealed

- private
- non-exportable
- non-witnessed
- highest symbolic density

Used for:

- personal reflection
- journaling
- silent presence

Sealed is **inviolable**.

---

## 3. Agency Model

- The **actor** owns meaning.
- The system does not interpret, decide, or direct.
- The companion reflects descriptively or remains silent.

There is no progression logic.
There is no hidden curriculum.

---

## 4. Silence as a State

Silence is a valid and explicit outcome.

Architecturally:

- no forced next step
- no reminders
- no nudges
- no penalties for stopping

Silence must be reachable from any flow.

---

## 5. Pattern Mirror (Example)

Pattern Mirror demonstrates the architecture:

- input is voluntary
- output is descriptive
- patterns are labeled, not diagnosed
- truth-seeds are local and private
- Sealed content never leaves the device

Failure mode:

- if the model or API fails, the system returns a neutral sample
- UX remains intact

---

## 6. Language Layers

Language is constrained by register:

- Public: plain, concrete, non-authoritative
- Shared: reflective, contextual, optional
- Sealed: minimal, holding, non-directive

No layer may:

- promise outcomes
- claim authority
- escalate emotion to persuade

---

## 7. Evolution Strategy

Gratia evolves by:

- adding or refining registers
- tightening boundaries
- simplifying flows

It does not evolve by:

- deeper messages
- stronger tone
- charismatic leadership

---

## 8. Operational Guardrails

At runtime and in review:

- structure > copy
- limits > features
- reversibility > ambition

When in doubt:

- reduce
- slow down
- make leaving easier

---

## 9. Non-Goals

Gratia is not:

- a platform
- a belief system
- a therapy tool
- a community capture mechanism

If an implementation moves in these directions, it is rejected.

---

## 10. Closing

If Gratia requires explanation to be safe,
it is already broken.

This architecture exists so it can stand quietly,
without supervision.
