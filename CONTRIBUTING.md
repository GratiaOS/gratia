# Contributing to Gratia

Thank you for being here.

This project grows through care, restraint, and respect for limits.
Contributing to Gratia is less about adding features and more about **not breaking the field**.

---

## How to Contribute

You can contribute by:

- improving clarity (code, copy, structure)
- fixing bugs or rough edges
- simplifying existing systems
- documenting what already exists
- proposing small, reversible changes

You do **not** need to:

- add complexity
- make things more impressive
- increase engagement
- speed things up

---

## Before You Open a PR

Ask yourself:

- Does this respect actor agency?
- Does this reduce capture or increase it?
- Does this make it easier to leave?
- Does this keep Sealed content inviolable?

If the answer to any of these is unclear, pause.

---

## What We Do Not Do

This project has hard limits.

We do **not**:

- promise outcomes or transformation
- centralize voice or authority
- optimize for retention or addiction
- export or reuse Sealed content
- escalate emotion to persuade
- monetize the ritual itself

If your contribution conflicts with these, it won’t be merged.

---

## Scope and Pace

- Small changes are preferred.
- Reversible changes are ideal.
- Experiments should fail quietly.

Big rewrites, rebrands, or paradigm shifts are rarely accepted.

---

## Language and Tone

- Avoid spiritual authority language.
- Avoid motivational framing.
- Avoid "you should" statements.

Use:

- descriptive language
- grounded metaphors
- neutral, respectful tone

---

## Decision Process

Maintainers act as **field holders**, not owners.

Decisions are based on:

- alignment with existing documents
- long-term integrity
- minimal harm

Not on:

- loudness
- seniority
- popularity

---

## When in Doubt

If you are unsure:

- open an issue
- describe what you’re seeing
- do not propose a solution yet

Sometimes the best contribution is naming a tension.

---

## Leaving Is Allowed

You are free to:

- step back
- stop contributing
- disappear for a while

No explanations required.

The field remains.

Thank you for contributing with care.
