# Cross-Project Sync Meta Log

This document serves as a meta log for cross-project syncs between Gratia and M3. Its purpose is to bridge communication, track decisions, highlight overlapping efforts, and plan upcoming syncs.

## Principles

- **Dual-Language Flow:** Every protocol or doc can express itself in two registers:
  - **M3 (Engineer View):** precise, technical, universal, machine-readable.
  - **Gratia (Garden View):** relational, symbolic, embodied, divine feminine first.  
    This bilingual approach ensures both clarity for builders and nourishment for seekers.  
    Long-term vision: enable a UI toggle so users can switch between expressions of the same source.

## Latest Decisions

- _[Add recent decisions here, e.g. "Agreed on unified error handling strategy (2024-06-10)"]_

## Overlaps

- _[Document areas where Gratia and M3 efforts overlap, e.g. "Both projects implementing similar notification modules"]_

## Next Sync

- **Date/Time:** _[Next scheduled sync meeting]_
- **Agenda:**
  - _[List agenda items here, e.g. "Review API contract changes"]_
