# Code of Conduct

### Gratia — Holding the Field

This Code of Conduct exists to protect the field.
Not the brand. Not the ego. Not the loudest voice.

Gratia is a shared space held through restraint, clarity, and care.
Participation here implies respect for these boundaries.

---

## Core Principle

> **We protect agency. We do not capture attention.**

Everything below serves this principle.

---

## What We Expect

### Be grounded

- Speak from direct experience.
- Use clear, descriptive language.
- Stay close to what is concrete and observable.

### Respect boundaries

- Accept when someone does not engage.
- Respect silence as a valid response.
- Do not push for intimacy, explanation, or continuation.

### Keep power visible

- Name roles when they matter.
- Separate personal experience from collective decisions.
- Avoid positioning yourself as an authority.

### Allow people to leave

- No pressure to stay.
- No guilt for stepping back.
- No obligation to explain absence.

---

## What We Do Not Allow

### No harassment or coercion

- No personal attacks.
- No intimidation or threats.
- No repeated contact after a clear boundary.

### No spiritual or moral authority claims

- No claims of special insight, awakening, or superiority.
- No framing disagreement as lack of awareness or growth.
- No "channeling" authority over others.

### No manipulation through emotion

- No guilt-tripping.
- No fear-based framing.
- No pressure disguised as care or concern.

### No attention capture

- No performative vulnerability.
- No rallying followers.
- No attempts to center yourself or build dependency.

---

## Handling Tension and Conflict

- Pause before responding.
- Move from personal accusation to structural observation.
- Focus on roles, agreements, or boundaries — not character.

If something cannot be resolved calmly, it may be paused or closed.

---

## Enforcement

Maintainers act as **field holders**, not judges.

They may:

- slow down conversations
- ask for clarification
- set boundaries
- remove content that breaks these guidelines

Decisions are made to protect the field, not to win arguments.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- repositories and issues
- pull requests and reviews
- discussions and comments
- any space officially connected to Gratia

---

## Closing

Gratia works when people feel free.

Free to speak.
Free to pause.
Free to leave.

If that freedom is compromised, the field is adjusted.

Thank you for helping hold it.
